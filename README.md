# Roasts

A weekend hack that I'm going to use for sharing information on my coffee roasts (this probably isn't for you).

Yea yea yea I know I am pretty bad at frontends. If you feel so inclined to improve this situation, feel free to open a PR.

The only reason I even made this repo public is because I wanted a cheap (free) way to host the public site on GitHub Pages ü§∑Ô∏è

## Setup
- `public` - the public website [aro.coffee](https://aro.coffee/)
- `uploader` - a tool for me to quickly/easily upload my roast data. `cd uploader && go build`
